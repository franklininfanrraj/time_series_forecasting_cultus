# time_series_forecasting_cultus
A synthetic multivariate time-series dataset was generated to simulate real-world temporal behavior. The dataset contains 1095 daily observations (3 years) with five input features (f1–f5) and one target variable. The data incorporates trend, weekly seasonality, noise, and autocorrelation, making it suitable for time-series forecasting experiments.
